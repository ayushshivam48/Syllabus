### 1. Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (AI)

**Definition**:  
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the branch of computer science that aims to create systems that can perform tasks that would normally require human intelligence.

**Importance of AI**:
- Automation of repetitive tasks.
- Decision-making with high accuracy.
- Data analysis and pattern recognition.
- Enhancing user experience (e.g., chatbots, recommendation systems).
- Used in robotics, healthcare, finance, gaming, etc.

### 2. AI Problems

AI focuses on solving problems that require reasoning, planning, learning, or decision-making.

#### Examples:

1. **Tic-Tac-Toe Problem**:
   - A simple two-player game.
   - Goal: Build an AI that can play and win or draw.
   - Involves game trees and minimax algorithm.

2. **Water Jug Problem**:
   - Given two jugs with different capacities, find a series of steps to get the desired quantity.
   - Solved using **state space representation**.

### 3. Application Areas of AI

- **Expert Systems** – Decision-making in domains like medicine, law.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** – Chatbots, language translation.
- **Robotics** – Autonomous vehicles, industrial robots.
- **Computer Vision** – Face recognition, image classification.
- **Gaming** – AI opponents, game strategies.
- **Healthcare** – Diagnosis, personalized treatment.
- **Finance** – Fraud detection, trading algorithms.

### 4. Problem Representation in AI

How a problem is represented plays a key role in designing an AI solution.

#### 4.1 State Space Representation:

- **Definition**: Represents all possible states the system can be in and how transitions between states occur.
- **Components**:
  - Initial state
  - Goal state
  - Operators (actions)
  - Path cost (optional)
- **Example**: Water Jug Problem

#### 4.2 Problem Reduction Representation:

- Breaks a complex problem into smaller sub-problems.
- Uses AND-OR graphs.
- Helps in hierarchical planning and solving.

#### 4.3 Production System:

- Consists of:
  - **Set of rules (productions)**: IF condition THEN action
  - **Working memory**: Current state
  - **Control strategy**: Selects which rule to apply
- Used in expert systems and decision-making.

---

### 5. Characteristics of Production Systems

- **Simplicity**: Easy to modify rules.
- **Modularity**: Each rule is independent.
- **Flexibility**: Can handle new situations by adding new rules.
- **Transparency**: Easy to trace the logic behind actions.

### 6. Types of Production Systems

1. **Monotonic**:
   - Application of rules does not prevent the application of other rules in future.
   - Useful in theorem proving.

2. **Non-monotonic**:
   - Application of a rule may prevent the application of another rule.
   - Used in real-time systems.

3. **Deterministic**:
   - Rules produce predictable outcomes.
   - Suitable for well-defined problems.

4. **Non-deterministic**:
   - Multiple rules may be applied; outcomes are uncertain.
   - Used in planning, learning, and search problems.
