# ðŸ“˜ Module I: Introduction to AI and Problem Representation

## ðŸ”¹ What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?
AI is the science of building systems that mimic human intelligenceâ€”like learning, reasoning, problem-solving, and decision-making.

**Example:**  
Google Assistant understanding your voice and setting reminders is AI in action.

## ðŸ”¹ Importance of AI:
- **Automation:** Reduces manual work (e.g., self-driving cars).
- **Efficiency:** Speeds up decision-making (e.g., AI in stock trading).
- **Accuracy:** AI in healthcare can detect diseases from scans better than some doctors.

## ðŸ”¹ AI Problems:
- **Tic Tac Toe Problem:**  
  AI evaluates every possible move using algorithms like Minimax to always make the best move.

- **Water Jug Problem:**  
  You have a 4-liter and a 3-liter jug. Measure exactly 2 liters.  
  â†’ Represent as a state space and use search algorithms to find steps.

## ðŸ”¹ Application Areas of AI:
- **NLP:** Siri, Google Translate
- **Robotics:** Warehouse automation
- **Vision:** Face recognition on phones
- **Healthcare:** Diagnosis from X-rays
- **Gaming:** Chess AI like AlphaZero

## ðŸ”¹ Problem Representation:
- **State Space:**  
  Represent each situation (state) and possible actions (edges).  
  **Example:** Solving a maze.

- **Problem Reduction:**  
  Break problems into sub-problems.  
  **Example:** Tower of Hanoi.

- **Production System:**  
  IF condition THEN action rules.  
  **Example:** IF fuel = empty THEN refill.
