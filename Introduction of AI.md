# Module I: Introduction to AI and Problem Representation

## 1. Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (AI)
Artificial Intelligence is a branch of computer science that focuses on creating systems capable of performing tasks that normally require human intelligence. These include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, understanding natural language, and perception. The goal of AI is to create machines that can function intelligently and independently.

## 2. Importance of AI
AI has vast applications across industries:
- **Healthcare:** AI algorithms can detect diseases like cancer in medical images.
- **Finance:** Fraud detection systems use machine learning to flag unusual transactions.
- **Transportation:** Autonomous vehicles use AI for navigation and obstacle avoidance.
- **Customer Service:** Chatbots like Siri or Alexa respond to user queries.
- **Manufacturing:** Predictive maintenance uses AI to prevent equipment failure.

## 3. AI Problems
- **Tic Tac Toe Problem:** A 3x3 game where two players alternate marking spaces. AI can use the minimax algorithm to choose the best move.
- **Water Jug Problem:** Given two jugs (e.g., 4L and 3L) and an infinite water supply, measure exactly 2 liters. AI models the problem as a series of states and transitions.

## 4. Application Areas of AI
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Google Translate
- **Robotics:** Self-navigating vacuum cleaners
- **Expert Systems:** Medical diagnosis (MYCIN)
- **Machine Learning:** Spam email filtering
- **Computer Vision:** Facial recognition in social media
- **Speech Recognition:** Voice-to-text in smartphones

## 5. Problem Representations
- **State Space Representation:**  
  E.g., solving a maze. Each position in the maze is a state; moving to another position is an action.

- **Problem Reduction:**  
  E.g., solving the Tower of Hanoi by reducing the problem into moving smaller sets of disks.

- **Production Systems:**  
  Example: IF the light is red THEN stop.

### Characteristics:
- **Deterministic:** Same action always results in the same outcome.
- **Static:** The world does not change while solving.

### Types:
- **Monotonic:** Used in logical deduction.
- **Non-monotonic:** Used when new facts can change conclusions.
