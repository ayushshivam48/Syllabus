# Module III: Coding

## 1. Programming Practices
Good programming practices ensure code is readable, maintainable, and error-free.

- **Code Clarity**: Use descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes. Proper indentation and spacing improve readability.
- **Reusability**: Write functions or modules that can be reused across different parts of the program.
- **Modularization**: Divide a program into smaller, independent modules to improve clarity and maintainability.
- **Error Handling**: Use try-catch blocks, validations, and exception handling to make code robust.
- **Version Control**: Use tools like Git to track changes and collaborate with others efficiently.

## 2. Top-Down Approach
A design approach where the system is broken down from the top level into smaller components.

- Focuses on breaking a big problem into smaller sub-problems.
- Helps in understanding the overall structure before delving into details.

## 3. Bottom-Up Approach
A design strategy where development starts with the most basic components, which are then integrated into a complete system.

- Encourages development of reusable modules.
- Useful when components already exist or can be reused.

## 4. Structured Programming
A programming paradigm aimed at improving clarity by using control structures like sequence, selection (if/else), and iteration (loops).

- Avoids GOTO statements.
- Encourages logical flow and easier debugging.

## 5. Information Hiding
A principle where internal details of modules are hidden, exposing only necessary interfaces.

- Achieved using encapsulation.
- Enhances security and modularity.

## 6. Paired Programming
An agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation.

- Driver writes the code.
- Observer reviews each line as it is typed in.
- Improves code quality and facilitates knowledge sharing.
